### Biography
I received my B.E. from the Department of Automation, Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2016. I received my Ph.D. from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), advised by Tieniu Tan.

I am now a research scientist in ByteDance Research.

My main research interests include cross-modal learning, referring image segmentation, robot manipulation and action recognition.
